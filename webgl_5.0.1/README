Patches to enable WebGL support with EGLFS in Qt5.0.1

Validation:

WebGL tutorials at http://www.gpupowered.org/sand/launch2/, and html5test.com

Known issues:

- Qt configuration detection is really messy. Today the logic is as below, and will need to be cleaned up:

    if opengles2 in QT_CONFIG, enable graphics_surface
    if opengles2 in QT_CONFIG, remove GraphicsSurfaceGLX.cpp, and use NoX surface file.

- Surface is actually not getting used in WebGL, so only a dummy file exists. This needs to be cleaned up.

- EGLFS still needs patches that are not upstream. These are at, https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-29729
